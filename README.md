Turbulent drag reduction in a compressible channel flow.
Conservative form of the NS equations used.
Skin friction drag is one of the main causes for energy loss in
turbulent flows.
Develop a 3D compressible turbulent channel flow from scratch.
It performs direct numerical simulation(DNS) of supersonic flow.
Hybrid of central differencing and QUICK used based on 𝑃𝑒.
Parallelize the code using MPI in all three directions.
Validate our results for a 𝑴𝒂 = 𝟏. 𝟓 and 𝑹𝒆 = 𝟑𝟎𝟎𝟎.
Studied the effect of thermal stratification and liquid-infused
surfaces in turbulent drag reduction.
